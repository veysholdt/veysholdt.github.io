# Canva Chart Creator App

You can use this app to easily create bar, line, radar, pie, doughnut and polar area charts for your presentations by uploading a .csv file as data source.

### CSV Table structure

The table in the .csv file must have a specific structure so in can be parsed successully by the app. 

The structure is shown below:

<div align="center">
<img height="200" src="./assets/table-structure.png">
<img height="200" src="./assets/example-chart.png">
<img height="200" src="./assets/example-pie-chart.png">
</div>

<br/>

>**Note**
>Please make sure that the number of rows multiplied by the number of coloumns in your table does not exceed 200.
>In this example the number would be 12 * 3 = 36.

>**Note**
>If you do not want to have labels on the x-axis just insert a blank space instead.
>E.g. replacing Jan, Feb, Mrz etc. with spaces.
